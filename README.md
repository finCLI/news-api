ðŸš§ finCLI's own News API

## Founder's Letter

Hi my name is Dhairya Ostwal<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/dhairyaostwal">(@dhairyaostwal)</a>. It's been quite
sometime I started working on this project. Wanting to combine the evergrowing world of finance with something
useful and accessible lead me to build <a href="https://github.com/finCLI">finCLI</a>.

Several challenges in this project have grown me into a better person and I'm happy to continue it forward.

## What is finCLI

As it says bringing Finance Updates on your Command Line Interface. Hence the name finCLI!

## Why did we build our own NEWS API

Initially we planned to use Currents API which does have a **limited API requests per month**, which lead to thinking
about since we wanted to deliver the latest update on the following topics to the user. Another challenge was the
information has to be credible enough therefore **verified and trusted sources only**.
